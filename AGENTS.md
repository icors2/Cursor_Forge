# Agent instructions

This repo is a **Cursor project starter**. It is blank on purpose. Your job on first use is to turn it into a working project: MCP servers, skills, assets, and durable working memory.

Read `.cursor/rules/memory.mdc` before you write application code.

## Bootstrap (new project from this template)

If working memory `Status` is `unbootstrapped` or `bootstrapping`:

1. Follow the `bootstrap-project` skill (`.cursor/skills/bootstrap-project/SKILL.md`).
2. Infer the product and stack from the user's request. Ask only for decisions you cannot infer. Vague asks → `scope-feature` first.
3. Enable **only** the MCP servers this project will use. Copy configs from `assets/mcp-catalog.md` into `.cursor/mcp.json`. Use `${env:NAME}` — never real secrets.
4. Add project skills for multi-step workflows. Use `create-project-skill`.
5. Copy or create assets the project actually needs from `assets/` (templates, checklists, playbooks, recipes).
6. Run a lightweight threat model (`assets/reference/threat-model.md`) when the product handles auth, PII, payments, or public APIs.
7. Persist what you learned with `update-working-memory`.
8. Rewrite the **Project-specific** section below so later agents know how to run, test, and verify.
9. Finish with `npm run verify` (audit + secret scan).

Do not scaffold a platform the user did not ask for. Ship one complete, usable slice.

## Vibe loop (build → live URL)

1. Vague ask → `scope-feature` (one demo moment).
2. Build the slice; use `add-integration` + `assets/recipes/` for auth/DB/payments/AI/etc.
3. Breaks → `debug-issue`. Panic → `checkpoint-rollback` (git does not undo DB/uploads).
4. `verify-change` (smoke the critical path — compile alone is not enough).
5. User-facing UI → `polish-ui` before a public URL.
6. Security-sensitive → `security-review`.
7. Live URL → `deploy-app`. PR → `ship-change`.
8. Gate on `assets/checklists/definition-of-done.md`.

## Where knowledge lives

| Kind | Put it here | Apply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Durable facts, decisions, conventions, lessons | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | Working memory. Commit it. |
| Security non-negotiables | `.cursor/rules/20-security.mdc` | Always |
| Multi-step workflows | `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | On demand / by relevance |
| Feature recipes (auth, payments, …) | `assets/recipes/` | Via `add-integration` |
| Shared tools | `.cursor/mcp.json` | Project MCP (no secrets) |
| Catalogs, templates, playbooks, checklists | `assets/` | Read when needed |
| How to run and test | this file | Always |

Rules are short constraints. Skills are procedures. Do not dump a playbook into an always-apply rule.

## Working memory

Cursor does not keep chat history as memory. **Rules are the memory.**

- At the start of non-trivial work, read `.cursor/rules/memory.mdc`.
- After you learn a durable fact, decision, convention, or failure mode, follow `update-working-memory`.
- Keep `memory.mdc` short. Move detail into `decisions.mdc`, `conventions.mdc`, or `lessons.mdc`.
- Commit memory updates so later sessions and Cloud Agents inherit them.

## Hard constraints

- Never commit secrets. Never write tokens into rules, skills, `mcp.json`, or `assets/`.
- Never call AI/payment providers from the client with a secret key (including test-mode secrets).
- Project rules **must** be `.mdc`. A `.md` file in `.cursor/rules/` is ignored.
- Skill `name` in frontmatter **must** match the parent folder.
- User-level `~/.cursor/*` is **not** available to Cloud Agents. Keep everything this project needs in the repo.
- Sandbox may block writes to `.cursor/*.json`. If you cannot edit `mcp.json`, tell the user what to paste.
- Do not enable Cursor hooks from `assets/templates/hooks/` unless the user asked — they change every agent run.
- Cost awareness: `assets/reference/cost-and-quotas.md`.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

- User MCP, user skills, and user hooks do not apply here. Use repo files only.
- `.cursor/environment.json` `install` must stay idempotent. Long-running processes belong in `start` / `terminals`.
- Cloud MCP is configured in the Cursor dashboard as well as (optionally) `.cursor/mcp.json`. Prefer HTTP MCP. SSE and `mcp-remote` are not supported in Cloud Agents.
- Do not `docker compose up` from `install`. After scaffold, put Compose/dev servers in `start` / `terminals`.
- Team/dashboard MCP still required for Cloud; laptop `~/.cursor/mcp.json` does not apply. Enabled project servers: context7 (HTTP), playwright (stdio in the VM).
- If `npm` is missing on PATH, run scripts with the bundled Node under `~/.local/share/cursor-agent/versions/*/node`.

## Project-specific

- **Product:** Volleyball Manager — club seasons, rosters, live stats, volunteering, announcements. Audience: ADMIN, COACH, PLAYER, PARENT.
- **Stack:** Next.js App Router + Tailwind (`apps/web-client`), NestJS (`apps/api-server`), PostgreSQL + Prisma (`packages/database`), Socket.io, npm workspaces, Docker Compose. Spec: `Setup.md`, `system-prompt.md`, `docs/repo-plan.md`.
- **Status:** Plan active; **app packages not scaffolded yet.** Next implementation step is `docs/first-slice.md` (coach records a live stat; parent board updates).
- **Install:** none for an app yet. After scaffold: `npm install` at repo root (workspaces).
- **Run (planned):** `docker compose up --build` — Postgres + API + web. Bind API to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`.
- **Test / lint (planned):** workspace `npm test` / `npm run lint` per app. Not present until scaffold.
- **Verify a UI change:** two browsers/tabs — coach tap → parent live board. Use Playwright MCP when available. Until scaffold: `npm run verify` (audit + secret scan) only.
- **Env vars (names):** `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`. Optional: `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`, `PORT` / `API_PORT`, `CONTEXT7_API_KEY`, `REDIS_URL` (later). Values in `.env` / Cloud Secrets — never git.
- **MCP enabled:** `context7` (framework docs), `playwright` (browser smoke). Nothing else.
- **Domain skill:** `add-domain-module` for later plugins. Do not implement volunteer, iCal, announcements, coach notes, or season archive in the first slice.
- **Security:** auth + likely minor PII. Run `security-review` before shipping login or a public URL. `isDuesPaid` is ADMIN-only. Threat model in `decisions.mdc`.
- **Deploy URL / rollback:** none yet. Local Compose is the deploy target until a host is named.
- **Starter check:** `npm run verify` (or `node scripts/audit-cursor-setup.mjs` && `node scripts/scan-secrets.mjs`).
