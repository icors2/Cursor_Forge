# Audit Cursor setup

## Run the checker

```bash
node scripts/audit-cursor-setup.mjs
```

Fix every error it reports. Treat warnings as real unless you have a reason to keep them.

## Manual checks the script cannot do

1. `.cursor/rules/memory.mdc` matches reality (stack, MCP list, status).
2. `AGENTS.md` **Project-specific** is not still the placeholder if Status is `active`.
3. `.cursor/mcp.json` has only servers this project uses, each with `${env:…}` for secrets.
4. The user has set those env vars / Cloud Secrets. You cannot see the values — ask.
5. No secrets in git (`git grep` for `sk-`, `ghp_`, `xoxb-`, `AKIA` if relevant).
6. Cloud: `environment.json` `install` is idempotent; no long-running servers in `install`.

## If MCP is missing in Cloud Agents

Repo `mcp.json` is not enough. The user still needs dashboard / team MCP. Say so. Do not pretend laptop `~/.cursor/mcp.json` will apply.
